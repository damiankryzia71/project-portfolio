* CS2400 - Data Structures Advanced Programming by Damian Kryzia

* To execute the program, make sure that the Java Development Toolkit is installed on your computer. Then, in the command line, navigate to this directory.
* Type javac ExpressionTest.java
* Type java ExpressionTest [your input here]

* This project is the AirportApp that uses the Graph data structure. Using a directed, weighted graph the user can operate on a graph where airports are vertices and routes between them are edges.
* The implementation uses other ADTs: Queue, PriorityQueue, Stack, List, and HashMap.
* On execution, takes an input in the form of a postfix mathematical expression from the user in the command line. It converts the expression into an Expression Tree data structure.
