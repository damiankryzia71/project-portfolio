This project is the AirportApp that uses the Graph adt. Using a directed, weighted graph
//                  the user can operate on a graph where airports are vertices and routes between them are edges.
//                  The implementation uses other ADTs: Queue, PriorityQueue, Stack, List, and HashMap.
